To build a website on Replit that scrapes LinkedIn job listings and shows relocation support information, here's a step-by-step guide, along with additional features like contact emails for HR/CEO and an auto-email system based on your CV:

### 1. **Project Setup on Replit:**

* **Choose a language**: Start with Python or Node.js for web scraping and backend logic.
* **Install Libraries**: You will need libraries for web scraping (e.g., `BeautifulSoup`, `Selenium`, `Requests` for Python or `Puppeteer` for Node.js), as well as libraries for sending emails (`smtplib` for Python).

### 2. **Web Scraping Script (Python example):**

Install necessary libraries:

```bash
pip install beautifulsoup4 requests
```

Example script to scrape job listings from LinkedIn for relocation support:

```python
import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup

def scrape_jobs(job_type):
    url = f"https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/search?keywords={job_type}&location=Worldwide"
    headers = {'User-Agent': 'Mozilla/5.0'}
    response = requests.get(url, headers=headers)

    soup = BeautifulSoup(response.content, 'html.parser')

    jobs = []
    for job_listing in soup.find_all('div', class_='result-card'):
        job_title = job_listing.find('h3').text.strip()
        company_name = job_listing.find('h4').text.strip()
        job_link = job_listing.find('a')['href']
        # You can extract relocation info here if it appears in the job description
        relocation_info = "Relocation Supported" if "relocation" in job_listing.text.lower() else "No Relocation"

        jobs.append({'title': job_title, 'company': company_name, 'link': job_link, 'relocation': relocation_info})
    return jobs

job_type = "QA"  # Example for QA jobs
job_listings = scrape_jobs(job_type)

for job in job_listings:
    print(f"Job Title: {job['title']}\nCompany: {job['company']}\nRelocation: {job['relocation']}\nLink: {job['link']}\n")
```

### 3. **Website Frontend:**

* Use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (or React) to create a simple UI that takes input for the job type (e.g., QA) and displays the scraped job listings.
* You can also use a backend framework like Flask (for Python) to handle requests, and then render the scraped job data dynamically on the frontend.

Example HTML for search input:

```html
<input type="text" id="jobType" placeholder="Enter job type (e.g., QA)">
<button onclick="searchJobs()">Search</button>
<div id="jobResults"></div>
```

JavaScript for handling user input:

```javascript
function searchJobs() {
    const jobType = document.getElementById('jobType').value;
    fetch(`/search-jobs?job_type=${jobType}`)
        .then(response => response.json())
        .then(data => {
            let jobResults = '';
            data.jobs.forEach(job => {
                jobResults += `<div>
                                 <h3>${job.title}</h3>
                                 <p>${job.company}</p>
                                 <p>${job.relocation}</p>
                                 <a href="${job.link}">Job Link</a>
                                </div>`;
            });
            document.getElementById('jobResults').innerHTML = jobResults;
        });
}
```

### 4. **Auto-Email Based on CV and Job Description (Python Example):**

Use `smtplib` to send emails. Hereâ€™s an example of an auto-email function based on your CV and company JD.

Install `email` and `smtplib`:

```bash
pip install secure-smtplib
```

Example function:

```python
import smtplib
from email.mime.multipart import MIMEMultipart
from email.mime.text import MIMEText

def send_auto_email(cv, job_desc, recipient_email):
    sender_email = "youremail@example.com"
    sender_password = "yourpassword"

    # Set up the MIME
    msg = MIMEMultipart()
    msg['From'] = sender_email
    msg['To'] = recipient_email
    msg['Subject'] = "Job Application for QA Position"

    body = f"Dear Hiring Manager,\n\nI am writing to express my interest in the QA position. Please find attached my CV and the relevant experience matching the job description:\n\n{job_desc}\n\nMy CV is attached for your reference."
    msg.attach(MIMEText(body, 'plain'))

    # Add CV as attachment if needed
    # with open(cv, "rb") as attachment:
    #     part = MIMEBase('application', 'octet-stream')
    #     part.set_payload(attachment.read())
    #     encoders.encode_base64(part)
    #     part.add_header('Content-Disposition', f'attachment; filename={cv}')
    #     msg.attach(part)

    # Connect to Gmail's SMTP server
    with smtplib.SMTP_SSL('smtp.gmail.com', 465) as server:
        server.login(sender_email, sender_password)
        text = msg.as_string()
        server.sendmail(sender_email, recipient_email, text)

# Example usage
send_auto_email('path_to_cv.pdf', 'Job Description details here', 'hr@company.com')
```

### 5. **Additional Features:**

* **HR Email and CEO LinkedIn Profile**: You can use the LinkedIn API or scrape contact information of HRs and CEOs from LinkedIn profiles. Ensure you respect LinkedIn's terms of service while scraping.
* **Contact Information Display**: Include contact details such as HR or CEO emails on your website, ensuring privacy and legal compliance.
* **Job Search Filters**: Add filters such as "Relocation Support", "Job Type", "Location", etc., to refine job searches.

### 6. **Deployment on Replit**:

* Create a new Python project or Node.js project on Replit.
* Paste your backend code in the main file and frontend code in the appropriate HTML/JS files.
* Use the `Flask` framework (for Python) or `Express.js` (for Node.js) to run the server.

### 7. **Additional Suggestions**:

* **Privacy**: Be cautious when scraping LinkedIn, as it has strict rules around data scraping. Consider using their official API if necessary.
* **Job Application Automation**: Integrate more advanced features such as applying automatically to jobs with your CV attached, tracking responses, and logging applications.
* **Email Templates**: Customize the email templates based on the job description and your CV to tailor the communication better.
